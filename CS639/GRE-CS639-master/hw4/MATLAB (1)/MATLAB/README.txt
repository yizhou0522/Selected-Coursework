Challenge 1a - Index Map:
We used loadFocalStack function to first load the picture given the file directory. Then we used modified Laplacian as the focus measure to determine how focused a scene point is in an image. The result comes after we calculate the index map.


Challenge 1b:
We allowed the user to pick a scene point, and display the point in focus.
